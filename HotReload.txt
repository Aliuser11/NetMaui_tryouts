HOT RELOAD => change dotnet bot and property of the label when app is running

1. Open the file MainPage.xaml.
2. Find the Text property of the Label element that is assigned the value
‘Hello, World!’. Change this to ‘Aloha, World!’.
3. Switch back to your running app. You should see your label updated to
show your ‘Aloha, World!’ message.
4. In Solution Explorer, right click on the Resources folder, and from the
context menu choose Add existing item.
5. Use the file browser to select your custom Dotnet Bot that you
downloaded earlier.
6. Once your custom Dotnet Bot is imported, right click on the image in
the Resources folder and select Properties.
7. In the Properties window, ensure that the Build Action is set to
MauiImage.
8. Back in the MainPage.xaml file, note the Source property of the Image
element is set to dotnet_bot on line 42. Change this to the filename
(including extension) of the file you imported in step 4.
9. Save the changes to the MainPage.xaml file.
10. To the left of the Run button on the toolbar, note a button with a red
flame on it (see Figure 2.19). This is the Hot Reload button.
11. Click the Hot Reload button. At this point, Visual Studio will show you
a warning, letting you know that it can’t apply your changes with hot
reload, and that you’ll have to let it rebuild. Go ahead
